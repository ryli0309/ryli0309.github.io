      <p>The sky is a soft, flat blue, stretching over rooftops like old wallpaper. Your face feels stiff and unused from a night’s worth of weariness. Cold almost, even though the air is warm like cotton.
The beginnings of sunrise illuminate the sign above your head, granting the dirty vinyl with a fleeting moment of opalescence. Open 24 Hours, it says, and directs your attention to the nearly vacant car lot to your right.</p>
<p>You push the door open and step inside. There’s a faint humming sound that pulls softly at your attention. The diner is bright and spacious, flooded with clean light. You blink several times, swaying on the spot. From behind a long metal counter, a waitress nods at you, which you assume means <i>sit wherever you’d like.</i></p>
<p>You shuffle to a long booth, sliding onto the green vinyl seat. It’s solid and pleasantly cool against your thighs. From here, you can see the diner’s profile in full, see the modicum of other early-morning patrons, ruminating over their banana foster French toasts and fried tomatoes. It’s quiet, but in the same way a forest is quiet—alive and full of unobtrusive kinetic motion.</p>
<p>Another waitress walks over to you, holding a stack of menus and a steaming metal pitcher. “Coffee?” she asks, not unkindly, but with an indifference. You nod, croak something that sounds like yes please, and watch as the liquid finds home in the mug that has somehow materialized near your fingertips. The first sip is dark and bitter and unremarkable as anything, but it scorches away the dreams still gummed up in your sinuses, unhinges your face a little.</p> 
<p>There’s a little bit of everything at Ritter’s, and the menu is as intimidating as it’s a blessing. You decide you’re in the mood for pancakes.</p>
<p>There is an old jukebox jutting out from window next to the salt and pepper shakers, and the table cards advertising $2.95 baked custard with strawberries. You feel the momentary urge to play something, to hear the soft croon of Frank Sinatra or Barry Manilow, but you decide against it. In a way, the ambient sounds of your surroundings are enough for this hour. The street noise from outside is muffled at best, like it’s been masked by a layer of snow.</p>
<p>Your breakfast arrives before long, blueberry pancakes and a plate of single-serve butters and little syrup cups. You drown your food in refined sugars and pour the rest of the syrup into your cooling coffee. It’s filling, stick-to-your-ribs food—food that feels good more than it tastes good.</p>
<p>As you eat, the morning starts to fill out. The sky outside the diner’s windows streaks with champagne pink, filtering through the blinds and interrupting your space. You watch as your fork glints on its way to your mouth, how suddenly the energy in the diner shifts. Little by little, the romance fades into something more familiar. You lean back in your seat and frown at the remains of pancake left on your plate. The detritus stares back at you, sheened in leftover butter and syrup.</p> 
<p>Perhaps it’s time to go.</p>
<p>You gather your things and slide out of the booth. You pay for your meal in ones at the cash register by the door. The resulting whirr and clang of the waitress handing back your change is almost too loud and brings you back to reality with a solid tug. You look around. Someone shoulders past you. You don’t remember there being this many people. Your table has already been cleared for a family of five.</p> 
<p>You exit the way you came and step out into the sun.</p>
