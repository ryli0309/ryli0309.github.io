			<h3>WANT TO GET INVOLVED?</h3>
			<center>
			<p>We are always looking for more staff to join TRR, as the more eyes and opinions on the submissions the better! If you don't catch us at Pitt's <a href="https://www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/sorc/activitiesfair/">Activities Fair</a>, send us an email at <b>ThreeRiversReview@gmail.com</b> so we can add you to the email list. After that, we will send you the poetry or fiction packets, and it’s up to you to read them, mark them “yes” or “no," and then come to meetings! Meetings are once a week, Fiction on Tuesdays and Poetry on Wednesdays, both at 9pm on the 35th floor of the Cathedral of Learning. No previous experience in "editing" is required; we just ask that all prospective members have a passion for writing and literature!
