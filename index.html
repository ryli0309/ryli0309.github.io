			<h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>
			<p>In 1995, a small magazine, <i>Thirst</i> was born. The project of a small group of undergraduates, <i>Thirst</i>'s goal was to discover and publish the best literature in the University of Pittsburgh community. Be it a small booklet, or a full-scale magazine, the students' sole focus was that it was comprised of work representative of the best of what undergraduates were producing.
				With the continuing support of the University of Pittsburgh University Honors College, <i>Thirst</i> eventually evolved into Three Rivers Review.</p>
			
				<p>Today, <i>Three Rivers Review</i> has grown to become a community-based literary magazine, crossing university boundaries and welcoming submissions from undergraduates attending all of Pittsburgh's colleges and universities. Literature is not relegated or restricted to a particular group due to its alma mater, and by extending the diversity of submissions, students' works may also be shared with a greater audience.
Throughout this entire process, <i>Three Rivers Review</i> has remained dedicated to the original goal of publishing the best undergraduate writing available. This process inherently leads to a battle against what Helen Vendler has termed "the invisibility of poetry in America to all but the converted."
With the stories and poems published here, <i>Three Rivers Review</i> has become a respected outlet for those students who are trying to say:	</p>
			<blockquote>"Listen, literature is not dead; it is growing and breathing, gaining new voices and audiences. Progress is slow, if it comes at all, but those of us who have already been converted know the importance of striving toward a visible and penetrating art. And these are the places where it begins."</blockquote>
			
			<p>In essence, <i>Three Rivers Review</i>'s goal is (and always has been) to expose undergraduate writers who have crafted unique pieces of fiction and poetryâ€”and deserve a published voice.</p>
