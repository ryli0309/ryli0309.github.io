			<h3>OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
			<p><b>Editors-in-Chief:</b></p>
			<p>The responsibilities of the Editors-in-Chief are to oversee the actual production of the magazine by promoting the submission process, delegating tasks to poetry and fiction editors as well as all officers, sending out poetry and fiction packets, helping with the compilation of the final magazine, and handling relations and communication with the club advisor.
			<p><b>Fiction and Poetry Editors:</b></p>
			<p>These editors work closely with the Editors in Chief, acting as their sort of “right-hand (wo)men,” helping with anything that they ask of them. Furthermore, they are the ones who facilitate discussion and voting during the meeting.</p>
			<p><b>Head of Publicity:</b></p>
			<p>This person does a lot of cross work with the other officers, especially regarding advertising for our magazine as well as public relations. He or she must have ideas on how to promote the magazine and must be passionate about doing so.</p>
